```json
{
  "tool": "proposed_tool_name",
  "parameters": {
    "param1": "description",
    "param2": "description"
  },
  "description": "What this tool would do"
}
```

## Alternative Solutions
Describe any alternative solutions or features you've considered.

## Data Source Requirements
- [ ] Requires new government data source
- [ ] Enhances existing data source coverage
- [ ] Improves data processing/indexing
- [ ] No new data sources needed

**If new data source required:**
- **Source Name**: [e.g., CERT/CC, MS-ISAC, etc.]
- **Data Type**: [e.g., vulnerability advisories, threat intelligence, etc.]
- **Update Frequency**: [e.g., daily, weekly, real-time]
- **Justification**: [why this source is critical for cybersecurity professionals]

## Expected Benefits
- [ ] Improves agent query accuracy
- [ ] Reduces agent processing time
- [ ] Provides new intelligence capabilities
- [ ] Enhances threat detection
- [ ] Improves compliance coverage
- [ ] Other: ___________

## Agent Integration Impact
How would this feature integrate with existing AI agent workflows?

```python
# Example usage
result = await client.proposed_tool_name(
    parameter1="value",
    parameter2="value"
)
```

## Performance Considerations
- **Expected query volume**: [e.g., 100/day, 1000/hour]
- **Response time requirements**: [e.g., < 500ms]
- **Caching potential**: [can results be cached?]
- **Rate limiting needs**: [special considerations?]

## Security Considerations
- [ ] Handles sensitive threat intelligence
- [ ] Requires additional authentication
- [ ] Involves external API integrations
- [ ] May expose new attack vectors
- [ ] No special security requirements

## Priority Level
- [ ] Critical - Blocks production agent deployment
- [ ] High - Significantly improves agent capabilities  
- [ ] Medium - Nice to have enhancement
- [ ] Low - Future consideration
